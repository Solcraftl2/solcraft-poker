    question: "How does tournament investment work?",
    answer: "You can browse upcoming or live poker tournaments on our platform. By purchasing tournament-specific tokens, you are essentially buying a share of the player's buy-in. If the player wins, the prize money (after platform fees) is distributed proportionally to all token holders.",

    question: "What are the risks involved?",
    answer: "Like any investment, there are risks. The primary risk is that the player does not win any prize money, in which case the initial investment may be lost. We provide an AI-powered risk assessment for each tournament to help you make informed decisions. Other risks include market volatility and smart contract vulnerabilities. Always do your own research.",

    question: "What is a Layer 2 solution?",
    answer: "A Layer 2 (L2) is a secondary framework or protocol built on top of an existing blockchain (like Solana, which is Layer 1). The main goal of L2s is to improve scalability and efficiency by processing transactions off the main chain, resulting in faster speeds and much lower fees, while still relying on the security of the main blockchain.",

    question: "How do I connect my wallet?",
    answer: "Navigate to your Profile page and click the 'Connect Wallet' button. A dialog will appear with a list of supported Solana wallets (like Phantom, Solflare, etc.). Select your wallet and approve the connection from within your wallet's browser extension or mobile app.",

    question: "What are the fees on SolCraft?",
    answer: "Our fees vary based on the service. For tournament investments, we charge a small percentage of the winnings, which depends on your investment tier. Swap transactions have minimal network fees thanks to our L2 infrastructure. All fees are transparently displayed before you confirm any transaction.",
