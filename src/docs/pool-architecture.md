SolCraft L2 - Pool Architecture & LiquidityManagement Overview: Multi-Pool Ecosystem ArchitectureCore PhilosophySolCraft L2 operates on a sophisticated multi-pool architecture where different types of funds are segregated, managed, and redistributed according to specific rules. This system ensures maximum security, transparency, and efficient capital allocation while protecting all stakeholders through automated risk management.Pool Ecosystem Structure┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐│ SolCraft L2 Pool Ecosystem │├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤│ Investment Pools │ Security Pools │ Operational Pools ││ ┌─────────────┐ │ ┌─────────────┐ │ ┌─────────────┐ ││ │Tournament │ │ │Player │ │ │Platform │ ││ │Investment │ │ │Deposit │ │ │Fee │ ││ │Pool │ │ │Pool │ │ │Pool │ ││ └─────────────┘ │ └─────────────┘ │ └─────────────┘ ││ ┌─────────────┐ │ ┌─────────────┐ │ ┌─────────────┐ ││ │Liquidity │ │ │Compensation │ │ │Development │ ││ │Provider │ │ │Pool │ │ │Pool │ ││ │Pool │ │ └─────────────┘ │ └─────────────┘ ││ └─────────────┘ │ ┌─────────────┐ │ ┌─────────────┐ ││ ┌─────────────┐ │ │Insurance │ │ │Governance │ ││ │Staking │ │ │Pool │ │ │Pool │ ││ │Rewards │ │ └─────────────┘ │ └─────────────┘ ││ │Pool │ │ │ ││ └─────────────┘ │ │ │└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ Core Pool Architecture1. Tournament Investment PoolPurpose & FunctionPrimary Function: Aggregate investor funds for tournament backingSecondary Function: Provide liquidity for token tradingTertiary Function: Generate yield through strategic allocationPool Composition:- Active tournament investments (70-80%)- Reserve liquidity for withdrawals (15-20%)- Strategic reserves for opportunities (5-10%)Investment Flow LogicInvestor Deposit → Tournament Investment Pool → Tournament FundingFlow Process:1. Investor deposits funds (various tiers)2. Funds allocated to Tournament Investment Pool3. Pool automatically funds tournaments based on demand4. Returns flow back to pool for distribution5. Profits distributed to investors based on token ownershipPool Management:- Automated rebalancing based on demand- Risk-weighted allocation across tournaments- Liquidity management for instant withdrawals- Performance tracking and optimizationSmart Contract Pool Managementcontract TournamentInvestmentPool {struct PoolState {uint256 totalDeposits;uint256 activeTournaments;uint256 availableLiquidity;uint256 pendingWithdrawals;uint256 totalReturns;}mapping(address => uint256) public investorShares;mapping(uint256 => TournamentAllocation) public tournamentAllocations;PoolState public poolState;function depositToPool(uint256 amount, uint8 investorTier) external {require(amount >= getMinimumInvestment(investorTier), "Below minimum");// Calculate shares based on current pool valueuint256 shares = calculateShares(amount);investorShares[msg.sender] += shares;// Update pool statepoolState.totalDeposits += amount;poolState.availableLiquidity += amount;// Auto-allocate to tournaments if demand existsautoAllocateToTournaments();}function autoAllocateToTournaments() internal {// Scan for underfunded tournaments// Allocate based on risk/reward profiles// Maintain minimum liquidity reserves}}2. Player Deposit Pool (Security Pool)Ranking-Based Deposit ArchitecturePool Structure by Player Ranking:PLATINUM Deposit Sub-Pool (10% deposits):- Lowest risk, highest trust players- Fastest deposit release times- Minimal monitoring requiredGOLD Deposit Sub-Pool (25% deposits):- Medium-low risk players- Standard monitoring protocols- Regular performance reviewsSILVER Deposit Sub-Pool (50% deposits):- Medium risk players- Enhanced monitoring- Quarterly ranking reviewsBRONZE Deposit Sub-Pool (100% deposits):- Higher risk, new players- Intensive monitoring- Monthly performance evaluationsUNVERIFIED Deposit Sub-Pool (150% deposits):- Highest risk category- Maximum monitoring- Weekly status checksDeposit Pool Flow LogicPlayer Registration → Ranking Assessment → Deposit Calculation → PoolAllocationDeposit Flow Process:1. Player applies for tournament2. System calculates required deposit based on ranking3. Player deposits funds to appropriate sub-pool4. Funds locked until tournament completion5. Outcome determines fund distributionPool Redistribution Logic:- Tournament Win + Prize Delivered: Full refund to player- Tournament Loss: 10% penalty to Platform Fee Pool, 90% refund- Prize Not Delivered: 100% to Compensation Pool + player ban- Disqualification: 100% to Compensation Pool + immediate banAdvanced Deposit Pool Managementcontract PlayerDepositPool {struct SubPool {uint256 totalDeposits;uint256 lockedFunds;uint256 availableForWithdrawal;uint256 penaltyFunds;PlayerRank rankCategory;}mapping(PlayerRank => SubPool) public subPools;mapping(address => PlayerDeposit) public playerDeposits;function processDepositOutcome(address player,bool tournamentWon,bool prizeDelivered) external {PlayerDeposit storage deposit = playerDeposits[player];SubPool storage subPool = subPools[deposit.rank];if (tournamentWon && prizeDelivered) {// Success case - full refundsubPool.lockedFunds -= deposit.depositAmount;payable(player).transfer(deposit.depositAmount);improvePlayerRanking(player);} else if (tournamentWon && !prizeDelivered) {// Violation case - forfeit to compensationsubPool.lockedFunds -= deposit.depositAmount;transferToCompensationPool(deposit.depositAmount);banPlayer(player);} else {// Loss case - 10% penaltyuint256 penalty = deposit.depositAmount * 10 / 100;uint256 refund = deposit.depositAmount - penalty;subPool.lockedFunds -= deposit.depositAmount;subPool.penaltyFunds += penalty;payable(player).transfer(refund);transferToPlatformFeePool(penalty);}}} Security & Compensation Pools3. Compensation PoolPurpose & Funding SourcesPrimary Purpose: Compensate investors for player violationsSecondary Purpose: Provide emergency liquidity for platform issuesFunding Sources:- Forfeited player deposits (100% of deposit when prize not delivered)- Platform fee allocation (10% of all platform fees)- Insurance payouts for covered events- Emergency fund contributions from governancePool Allocation Rules:- 80% for direct investor compensation- 15% for platform stability reserves- 5% for legal and recovery costsCompensation Distribution LogicCompensation Trigger Events:1. Player wins but doesn't deliver prize2. Player disqualified for cheating3. Technical platform failures4. Force majeure events affecting tournamentsDistribution Algorithm:- Affected investors identified automatically- Compensation calculated based on investment amount- Priority given to larger investors (but proportional)- Automatic distribution within 24 hoursCompensation Calculation:Investor Loss = Investment Amount + Expected ReturnCompensation = min(Investor Loss, Available Pool Funds / Number of Affected Investors)Smart Contract Compensation Logiccontract CompensationPool {struct CompensationClaim {address investor;uint256 investmentAmount;uint256 expectedReturn;uint256 actualLoss;bool compensated;uint256 compensationAmount;}mapping(uint256 => CompensationClaim[]) public tournamentClaims;uint256 public totalPoolFunds;uint256 public reserveFunds;function processPlayerViolation(uint256 tournamentId,address violatingPlayer,uint256 forfeitedDeposit) external {// Add forfeited deposit to pooltotalPoolFunds += forfeitedDeposit;// Identify affected investorsaddress[] memory investors = getTournamentInvestors(tournamentId);// Calculate total compensation neededuint256 totalCompensationNeeded = 0;for (uint i = 0; i < investors.length; i++) {uint256 investment = getInvestorAmount(tournamentId, investors[i]);uint256 expectedReturn = calculateExpectedReturn(investment);totalCompensationNeeded += investment + expectedReturn;}// Distribute compensation proportionallyfor (uint i = 0; i < investors.length; i++) {uint256 investorLoss = getInvestorAmount(tournamentId, investors[i]);uint256 compensation = (investorLoss * totalPoolFunds) /totalCompensationNeeded;// Ensure we don't exceed pool fundsif (compensation > totalPoolFunds) {compensation = totalPoolFunds;}payable(investors[i]).transfer(compensation);totalPoolFunds -= compensation;// Record compensationtournamentClaims[tournamentId].push(CompensationClaim({investor: investors[i],investmentAmount: investorLoss,expectedReturn: calculateExpectedReturn(investorLoss),actualLoss: investorLoss,compensated: true,compensationAmount: compensation}));}}}4.
